{% contentfor intro %}
At PennApps Spring 2014, my team brought the classic Bop It! toy to the modern era with Leap Motion. I worked with [Mariel Bartolome](https://twitter.com/whatmariel), [Luis Santos](https://twitter.com/_lssr), and [Zach Fogg](https://twitter.com/zfogg) to develop the project. Players use mid-air gestures to control an immersive web game.
